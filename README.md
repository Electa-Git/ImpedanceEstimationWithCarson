# DataDrivenImpedanceEstimationWithCarson
Should we rename this repository?



## Summary
This is a Julia package containing data and code to perform the estimation of (up to) four-wire impedance matrices for electric distribution networks, starting from measurement data (e.g., smart meters).
From a mathematical standpoint, this is achieved....

The package has four components.
- data....
- problem as an extension of PMD, relying on julia's JuMP
- ...
