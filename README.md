# DataDrivenImpedanceEstimationWithCarson
Should we rename this repository?

## Summary
This repository hosts a Julia package with code and data used to perform the estimation of (up to) four-wire impedance matrices for electric distribution networks, starting from measurement data (e.g., smart meters).
From a mathematical standpoint, this is achieved....

- The source code itself is available under a MIT license (see [LICENSE](LICENSE) file)
- The yearly fifteen minute resolution power profiles are from ...
- The linecode data for the impedances is released under a CC-BY 4.0 license ,...., mention it comes from gridqube and public data
- The .dss files come from ....

A paper is under review, [preprint available here](https://arxiv.org/).

Keywords: ...

## TODOs
- agree on/double-check licenses, both of code and data
- add a few unit tests based on the validation test cases

## Funding

This project results from a collaboration between KU Leuven/EnergyVille (Leuven and Genk, Belgium), CSIRO Energy (Newcastle, NSW, Australia) and GridQube (Springfield Central, QLD, Australia) and has received funding from the Flanders Innovation & Entrepreneurship (VLAIO)'s IMPROCAP project, the **XXXXXX project @rahmat to fill in from CSIRO, Fred also adds something?**. The collaboration involved a long oversea stay that received a grant from the Science Foundation: Flanders (FWO).
